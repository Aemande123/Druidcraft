Druidcraft is a druid-themed mod currently in *extremely* early stages! Out for release in 1.14 to populate the modding community and gain some feedback. There's tons planned! Spells, runecarving, beast-mastery, conjuration, herbalism are just some of the planned features!

### Features!

The following features are in the current build, and more will be added soon!:

- Bone tools, weapons and armour!
- Hemp crop for easy string! Also used for rope, which allows easier creation of leads. Placeable rope planned for later!
- Darkwood forests and darkwood itself! A very dark, soft wood with a unique look to it. It will have a few unique uses further on.
- New decorative wood blocks! Wooden beams to properly embolden your structures, and wood panels with a softer feel than planks to use for walls or floors!
- Four new ores! Amber, moonstone, fiery glass and rockroot. They're near useless at the moment, but tons is planned for them! *( Experience drops on them are turned up a little bit in the meantime just to make up for it. ;) )*
