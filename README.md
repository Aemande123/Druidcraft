# Druidcraft

This Minecraft mod is one that revolves around a much more laid back sort of druid. One that wouldn't fret about automating everything in life, but enjoying what it has to offer. Whether it's fighting bosses, discovering new fey or beasts, brewing up teas and poultices, decorating your little grove, or pushing yourself to the status of an archdruid and discovering all the spells, there's something for every aspiring druid in Druidcraft.

This is a work in progress!
