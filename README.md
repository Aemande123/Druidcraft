Druidcraft is a druid-themed mod currently in *extremely* early stages! Out for release in 1.14 to populate the modding community and gain some feedback. There's tons planned! Spells, runecarving, beast-mastery, conjuration, herbalism are just some of the planned features!

### Features!

The following features are in the current build, and more will be added soon!:

- Bone tools, weapons and armour!
- Hemp crop for easy string! Also used for rope, which allows easier creation of leads. Placeable rope planned for later!
- Darkwood forests and darkwood itself! A very dark, soft wood with a unique look to it. It will have a few unique uses further on.
- New decorative wood blocks! Wooden beams to properly embolden your structures, and wood panels with a softer feel than planks to use for walls or floors!
- Four new ores! Amber, moonstone, fiery glass and rockroot. They're a little useless in some regards, but tons is planned for them! *( Experience drops on them are turned up a little bit in the meantime just to make up for it. ;) )*
- Beetles! The beetle is a hostile, tanky looking bug that has grown to such a size that it can't fly, nor does it need to! It's extremely dangerous, but if you're feeling cocky then golden apples should suit its tastes.
- Dreadfish! Ever wanted a glow-in-the-dark, skeletal ghost-fish? Well now you can have one! While hostile normally, should you tame it with prismarine crystals it will love you forever! It's even dyeable!
- Mud bricks, an amazingly early-game building material that is bound to please the eyes. To craft it, you just need some dirt, and to be standing in the water. It's a bit of dirty work, but it's well worth it! Once made, place them down, and they should dry over time.
- Sickles! Who doesn't want to mow the grass out of an area in a pinch? Say goodbye to the water bucket and hello to the sickle! The higher the tier, the bigger the area, and the best part is that they make decent weaponry too!
- Soulfire, the flaming soul of a dreadfish. Should you manage to slay a few of the spooky fish, you should come across this magical stuff. It's placeable as a light source, and can be dyed in a crafting table, just like the living thing!
- Fiery torches! They're like regular torches, but much better! Using fiery glass, you can create a waterproof, brighter torch that just looks more amazing than the old, boring torch you're probably used to. 
- Moonstone gear, made from the elusive moonstone! It's a tier above diamond, but will require diamond to obtain. 
- Chitin armor! As a reward for fending off all those beetles, you can use the chitin they drop to make decent armour! It's roughly between iron and diamond tier in quality.
- Fiery glass is now smeltable! It'll do a good 12 smelts, so make sure to grab a bunch.
